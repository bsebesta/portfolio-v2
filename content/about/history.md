title: A Little History
---
My interest in technology and design started as a kid growing up in California. When my parents saw me tinkering with code on MySpace and Neopets, they got me Microsoft Frontpage for a present. In the next few years I made several websites, including a big one focused on my passion for LEGO Bionicle. This was the start of my love for web design.

I was fortunate to attend a High School with an incredible computer program, and became the captain of the Varsity Web Team, teaching web design to peers and junior classmen (and becoming known by my teachers as the kid to ask about computer problems).

I moved to Utah to attend college. There, I changed my career plan many times (History teacher? Instructional Designer?). But I soon discovered UX and learning everything I could about it, becoming president of the nascent UX club in the process.

After graduation, I did UX field research and interviews for the award-winning [Day One App](https://dayoneapp.com/). From there, I took a job with RAIN Agency in New York City, where I lived and worked for several years.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve had a number of odd jobs. I've been a marketing director; an adjunct at a university, teaching UX and conversational UI design; a presenter and taste guide at an artisanal chocolate shop; an instructional designer for an IT company; the voice recorder of an audiobook; and a Sunday School teacher for teens. This breadth of experience has helped me become an [eclectic generalist]({{< relref "eclectic-generalists" >}}) and made life more interesting.
