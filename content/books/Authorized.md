title: Authorized
subtitle: The Use and Misuse of the King James Bible
description: "The King James Version has shaped the church, our worship, and our mother tongue for over 400 years. But what should we do with it today? The KJV beautifully rendered the Scriptures into the language of turn-of-the-seventeenth-century England. Even today the King James is the most widely read Bible in the United States. The rich cadence of its Elizabethan English is recognized even by non-Christians. But English has changed a great deal over the last 400 years―and in subtle ways that very few modern readers will recognize. In Authorized Mark L. Ward, Jr. shows what exclusive readers of the KJV are missing as they read God's word. In their introduction to the King James Bible, the translators tell us that Christians must 'heare CHRIST speaking unto them in their mother tongue.' In Authorized Mark Ward builds a case for the KJV translators' view that English Bible translations should be readable by what they called 'the very vulgar'―and what we would call 'the man on the street.'"
