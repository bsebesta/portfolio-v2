title: A Little Context
---

I'm Bryan. I'm a people-centered designer with six years of experience in UX.

For the past five years I've led UX design at [RAIN Agency](https://www.rain.agency/) in New York City, a pioneer in conversational AI. I've worked with 20+ teams at companies like Headspace, Wynn Resorts, Autotrader, Nike, Nestlé, Amazon, Suffolk Construction, and US Veterans' Affairs.

I do my best work when I'm championing human-centered products that meet a real need in the world—all while working with passionate coworkers working in tight design-build-learn feedback loops.

My strengths include problem solving, UX strategy, managing or reducing complexity, and research. I especially love being out in the field, talking to real people and having my own assumptions challenged.

I'm passionate about ethical technology, accessibility, and mentoring other designers. In my spare time, you might find me reading, hiking in the Great Outdoors, discussing philosophy with friends, or chasing my kid around the backyard.

I'm currently looking for new opportunities, wherever they take me. Feel free to drop a line [over email](mailto:hello@bryansebesta.com) or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryansebesta).
