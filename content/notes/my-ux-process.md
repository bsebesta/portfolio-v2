It's been said that "Plans are useless but planning is indepensible."

There's a similar truth with the idea of "UX process." Any process is useless the moment it encounters the real world—which is complex, fast-moving, and unpredictable. In such a world, continuous every project is a work-in-progress.

At the same time, a default process, checklist, or basic approach is a good _presupposition_. It can't be a rigid rule, but it can be a useful default: a toolbox to draw on with wisdom and prudence.

## I have a process...
Broadly speaking, when I'm approaching a new product or flow in a relatively stable environment, my process looks something like the following[^1].

1. Understand the problem (from user, business, and technical POVs)
2. Determine the nature of the complexity—how, and how much
3. Use the appropriate tools (content maps, flows, lists) to manage the complex, guide the conversation, and render risky assumptions visible
4. Wireframe (if appropriate)
5. Set design direction
6. Present early, present often
7. Explore/ship/iterate, measuring along the way
8. Systematize

## ... but I never follow it perfectly
But I've never been in a project that follows that perfectly. "Relatively stable environments" are rare and _usually manufactured_—a useful but fruitless self-deception.

I believe that our modern design environment is complex, fast-moving, and unpredictable. That fact, together with the reality of how we can get design feedback asynchronously in teams anytime from nearly anyone anywhere, means **that any strict process breaks down**. It's either impossible, or if possible, not desirable because it works against the grain of our how things really are.

This is diagnosed eloquently by Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, in his excellent article [Welcome to the WIP](https://www.figma.com/blog/welcome-to-the-wip/)—one of the most important articles.

> Products today never get built in such a clear, linear, and picture-perfect way. The reality is so much messier. So why do we act like it isn’t?
> 
> Well, for a long time, this was the process. Back when product design meant physical products, it was materially important that everyone follow a carefully constructed, linear process. As the world became increasingly digital, the spaces we designed for became faster to build and iterate on. Product teams can ship an update in a matter of minutes versus leaving their users stuck with a design for years to come. Today, every digital product is a work in progress. And this has changed how we design.

Yamashita historicizes design, pointing out that _this linear mindset worked at one time; but it works no longer_. Other authors have made this same point. In their book [Sense and Respond]({{< relref "Sense and Respond" >}}), Gotthelf and Seiden call this the "manufacturing mindset." In his book [The Art of Action]({{< relref "The Art of Action" >}}), Stephen Bungay describes this same phenomenon as "legacy thinking," consisting of three basic principles:

1. It's possible to know all you need to know to be able to plan what to do
2. Planners and doers should be separated
3. There's only one right way to do things (or, "There's the Process!")

Bungay makes the same point Yamashita does: we live in a complex, fast-moving, unpredictable environment.

## We Need a New Approach
So in an ideal world, there's less a _linear process_ and more of a _system of recurring practices_ that help usher products into the future. Gotthelf and Seiden call this "continous deployment." We're always learning. We're always treating our project as a WIP.

Outlining some recurring practices that might facilitate such continous work, Yamashita makes three suggestions:

1. Reviewing work at a predictable cadence versus the perfect moment
2. Considering the form feedback takes as much as the feedback itself
3. Be less precious about the work that ships

This describes both a praxis and a culture that can work in a fast-moving, complex, and uncertain world.

Now, I think it's useful to have a rough process to follow. The process itself is a [jig]({{< relref "jigs-managing-complexity.md" >}}), a tool for managing the daunting complexity of building design.

But we can't treat the process as a hard-and-fast rule. Rather, **we ought to treat the process as a toolbox**—each part designd to perform certain things.
