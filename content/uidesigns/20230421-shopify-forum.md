Drawing from [this screenshot on SaasInterface](https://app.saasinterface.com/shopify-9/), I decided to recreate the Shopify Forum experience.

* The advantage of this is that Shopify has a wonderfully-documented design system, [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/), which greatly helped with cutting down time searching for icons.
* However, the forum itself (everything below the grey-background header) uses a _different_ icon set; perhaps for legacy reasons, but annoying and inconsistent.
* Similarly, the tab system in the Forum is distinctly different than the formally documented [Tabs](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/tabs) systems in Polaris. It looks fine, but this forum is definitely working in its own system.
* And one more inconsistency: the color of the two primary buttons ("Log In" and "Ask a Question") are slightly different from the top and the bottom. It looks fine, but again, working on its own system.

* A few components were made to speed up this copywork (see above). Notably, the tab system in the Forum is distinctly different than the formally documented [Tabs](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/tabs) systems in Polaris.
