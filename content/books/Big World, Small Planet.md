subtitle: Abundance within Planetary Boundaries
description: "We have entered the Anthropocene - the era of massive human impacts on the planet - and the actions of over seven billion residents threaten to destabilize Earth's natural systems, with consequences for human societies. The authors combine the latest science with storytelling and photography to create a new narrative for humanity's future and reject the notion that economic growth and human prosperity can only be achieved at the expense of the environment."
