title: First Principles and Ordinances
subtitle: The Fourth Article of Faith in Light of the Temple
description: "In First Principles and Ordinances, Samuel M. Brown begins the work of outlining a relationship-grounded theology by highlighting continuity between the gospel's first principles and ordinances and the highest ordinances of LDS temple worship. After encountering Brown's tapestry woven of personal stories, scripture, LDS history, and perspectives of other religious traditions, you'll never read the Fourth Article of Faith the same way again."
