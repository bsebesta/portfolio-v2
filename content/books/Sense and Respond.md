title: Sense and Respond
subtitle: How Successful Organizations Listen to Customers and Create New Products Continuously
description: "We’re in the midst of a revolution. Quantum leaps in technology are enabling organizations to observe and measure people’s behavior in real time, communicate internally at extraordinary speed, and innovate continuously. These new, software-driven technologies are transforming the way companies interact with their customers, employees, and other stakeholders. This is no mere tech issue. The transformation requires a complete rethinking of the way we organize and manage work. And, as software becomes ever more integrated into every product and service, making this big shift is quickly becoming the key operational challenge for businesses of all kinds. We need a management model that doesn’t merely account for, but actually embraces, continuous change. Yet the truth is, most organizations continue to rely on outmoded, industrial-era operational models. They structure their teams, manage their people, and evolve their organizational cultures the way they always have. Now, organizations are emerging, and thriving, based on their capacity to sense and respond instantly to customer and employee behaviors. In Sense and Respond, Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden, leading tech experts and founders of the global Lean UX movement, vividly show how these companies operate, highlighting the new mindset and skills needed to lead and manage them—and to continuously innovate within them. In illuminating and instructive business examples, you’ll see organizations with distinctively new operating principles: shifting from managing outputs to what the authors call 'outcome-focused management'; forming self-guided teams that can read and react to a fast-changing environment; creating a learning-all-the-time culture that can understand and respond to new customer behaviors and the data they generate; and finally, developing in everyone at the company the new universal skills of customer listening, assessment, and response. This engaging and practical book provides the crucial new operational and management model to help you and your organization win in a world of continuous change."

Right in the introduction, Gothelf and Seiden setup the main metaphors: the "two-way conversation" and "playbook". They contextualizes the "problem" this book diagnoses by explaining how the economy has shifted (mainly due to digital technology, and so the speed/complexity of today's markets demand a different *management* approach, a different playbook, from anyone building technology or technological products. To borrow a biblical metaphor, we can't put "new wine in old wineskins"; we have to revamp our institutions dramatically. The diagnosis is the same as in Bungay's "Art of Action" or Yamashita's article ["Welcome to the WIP."](https://www.figma.com/blog/welcome-to-the-wip/)

The first half of the book does a rigorous job outlining the diagnosis. The second half focuses on the playbook, which (they acknowledge) has been around for awhile: it's called agile. They note what makes agile different from the waterfall (industrial) approach, mainly: smaller batch sizes and continuous feedback from customers. And they note that this "Lean UX" approach (written about in their earlier book) often failed to be adopted becuase businesses were not setup to support it; hence, *this* book.

The rest is great. When I read this, I worked at an agency, where it was difficult to apply all of these ideas. But I hope to take another crack at these ideas in the future.
