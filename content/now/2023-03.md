It's been two months since I was laid off. I've cycled a lot of emotions, but mostly variations of _anxiety_.

I see anxiety in two types. There are basic anxieties around whether I'll be able to provide for myself and my family—food, drink, shelter, and clothing. But there's also the neurotic anxieties, fueled by social comparison, [status anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_Anxiety), perfectionism, and [insert general complaint about neo-liberal capitalism/modernity here].

In the past few months, I've gone through several job interviews—mainly focused on breaking out of the agency and voice UI worlds, into the SaaS or marketplace product and web/mobile UI worlds. In applying, I've realized I'm deficient in several key areas, fueling that status anxiety. Am I good? Am I wanted? (Is AI going to take all my future jobs away?!)

But the past few weeks have lent me some clarity. My anxiety is not yet about clothing and shelter—I'm lucky, with enough of a safety net where I can pause. I can take time to explore my options and re-skill myself properly; make connections and network in a non-desperate kind-of-way; and breathe before plunging back into the anxiety system that is the modern job market.

So I've decided to **declare war on neurotic and status anxieties**. I'm still working each day, practicing design and applying to jobs occasionally. But I'm also playing—playing with code, design, writing, type. And cooking more, running, and messing around on the guitar.

My main project is this revamped portfolio. I've been wanting to redesign my portfolio in good, old-fashioned code and make it a place where I can share my work and my writing on my terms. And working on it these past few weeks? It's been a dream. Design is _fun_ again.
