title: Alignment Matters
subtitle: The First Five Years of Katy Says
description: "Katy Bowman's Move Your DNA (2014), which explores the difference between exercise and movement, caused a mini-revolution in health and wellness circles. Since mainstream media caught wind, Bowman's furniture-free home, movement-based lifestyle, and scientific explanations of why we need to move have become staples in national health publications and online media around the world. But before Bowman became well known, she wrote down her ideas on movement and alignment in a blog called Katy Says. This revised edition of Alignment Matters contains the first five years of her posts, organized to function as a primer to alignment and better movement, and also to Bowman's more complex books."
