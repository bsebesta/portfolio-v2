I recreated the homepage of the AllTrails app in Figma. Some things learned:

* I'm 99% sure AllTrails uses the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) pack.
* The font is _close_ to San Francisco, but it's not _quite_ San Francisco.
* New Figma plugin discovery: [TinyImage Compressor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789009980664807964/TinyImage-Compressor), which allowed me to export this into WebP.
