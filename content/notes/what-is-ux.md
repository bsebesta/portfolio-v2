1. **A truth:** users experience design.
2. **A principle:** user oriented.
	* Virtue of "Product" design label is it supplements this user-focus with a greater emphasis on the business / market.
3. **A process:** It is primarily about crushing assumptions about users and business strategy. It's about rendering these assumptions and intentions visible.
	* 
4. **A craft:** design draws on a variety of disciplines, tools, methods, and materials. Takes time to master these.
	* When someone makes a distinction between UX / UI, they are usually talking about a deficiency in *craft*. This also goes to the question of "whether designers should code"—code is the *material* we use, and knowing it intimately can only help.
	* The full span of the UX discipline exists here.
	* Product designer also emphasizes craftmanship, the design of an actual *product* that can perform in the market.
5. **A tradition:** part of a great conversation about philosophy and ethics and approach and role in the world.
	* This includes articles like this one, "What is UX?" Another word for what is (and what *should be*) the role of design and designers in the modern world and economy.

Some notes:
* A project can be well crafted in a design sense, but if the *process* of UX was ignored (i.e. little-to-no user or market assumptions were validated), it will land with a thud. Similarly, user and market assumptions can be perfectly validated and reasoned toward a solution, but if the craftmanship is poor, it, too, may land with a thud. (Though the second situation is probably preferred.)
	* Again, this fact speaks to the reality that people often seek designers who have craftmanship-type skills.

What is user experience design? Precision here can feel like a moving target, but I think it useful to keep with "UX" (as opposed to "Product Design"—more on that term later).

UX, in my mind, is a truth, a principle, and a process.

## A Truth
Users _experience_ design.

It is our designs, mixed with context, that influences (though does not dictate) the experience of the human being encountering our product.

It's worth noting that we do not control all aspects of the experience. Our fellow human beings might use our product as we intended, or for something else entirely. They might be happy, or angry, or sad. They might be on a phone in a checkout line; a smart speaker in a kitchen; or a laoptop on a train. They might have fond feelings for our brand and product, or be predisposed to hate us for reasons rational or not.

We do not, in other words, get to dictate the state of the person approaching us. But we can do everything in our power to anticipate, and serve, their needs. 

## A Principle
Again: we can do everything in our power to serve the human being experiencing our design.

## A Process
Whenever we design, we make a thousand assumptions: about users, about pain points and jobs-to-be-done, about context, about business strategy, about the technology we can use. The goal of the UX process is to **render those assumption visible**—and then act to test them, methodically, and intelligently.

In a perfect world, no assumption goes untested. In our real world, assumptions are prioritized by risk, and the riskiest assumptions are tested first.

This process doesn't necessarily mean sitting in rooms, brainstorming from a room with sticky notes. It's a constant and iterative feedback loop between the product team and the customer—sensing and responding, trying and learning, again and again and again. The more we iterate, the more we learn. Iteration makes design a kind domain.

## Context
It's worth noting that we do not control all
* Arranging elements together to accomplish a particular purpose

UX Design is similar, but it is all

* A process—
* Rendering assumptions visible—and then acting to test them, methodically and intelligently.
* Rendering intent visible—and as Abby Covert points out, "language is the material of intent."
* Rendering the assumptions and intent, together, as a product. This ties back to Jared Spool's language.

UX Design is also characterized by certain characteristics:

* A deep understanding of user, context, material, business, and market
