title: Fleeing the Garden
subtitle: Reading Genesis 2-3
description: The papers collected in this book are the product of a Mormon Theology Seminarâ€”dedicated to generating close, theologically informed readings of the second and third chapters of Genesis. Though participants in the seminar employed a wide variety of methodological approaches, the results clearly show a common core of understanding won through months of close collaborative effort. Essays explore the nature of appetite, the role of community, the necessity of ecology, and the persistence of paradox in one of the Bible s most human stories.
