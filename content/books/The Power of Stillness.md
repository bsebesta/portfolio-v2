title: The Power of Stillness
subtitle: Mindful Living for Latter-day Saints
description: "Latter-day Saints are great at getting things done. But sometimes an excessive focus on 'doing more' can take us to a place where we're mostly going through the motions—and missing the deep, rich spiritual power that can come from being still. Using Latter-day Saint vernacular and examples, The Power of Stillness explores ways in which mindfulness can help deepen our conversion to the gospel. Infusing our homes with more stillness, silence, and space can reinvigorate the joy inherent in our faith and help us feel calmer, more present and engaged in our lives, and more spiritually connected to our Savior."
