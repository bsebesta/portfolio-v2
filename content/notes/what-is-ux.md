What is user experience design? Precision here can feel like a moving target, but I think it useful to consider six different angles to the question. UX is simultaneously:

1. A truth
2. A principle
3. A posture
4. A process
5. A craft
6. A tradition

## UX as Truth
The phrase "UX design" can be stated as a fact: users _experience_ design. Which is to say, it is our designs (in combination with context) that influences, though doesn't dictate, the experience. The experience might be goal-oriented, 

It's worth noting that we do not control all aspects of the experience. Our fellow human beings might use our product as we intended, or for something else entirely. They might be happy, or angry, or sad. They might be on a phone in a checkout line; a smart speaker in a kitchen; or a laoptop on a train. They might have fond feelings for our brand and product, or be predisposed to hate us for reasons rational or not.

We do not, in other words, get to dictate the state of the person approaching us. But we can do everything in our power to anticipate, and serve, their needs. We can do everything in our power to shape their experience.

## UX as Principle
From this truth, emerges a principle: we should be laser-focused on our users. We do everything in our power to serve the human being experiencing our design.

Jeff Bezos calls this "customer obsession." Though I don't love the idea of being "obssessed" with users—in truth, we're mindful of other factors, such as business needs, technical constraints, the like—it's a useful exaggeration to make a critical point: we never drop our gaze from being focused on the users. And we use whatever tools necessary (personas, job stories, etc) to keep our focus thus. Because we know that, at the end of the day, it's in our best interest to make a product that makes our customers happy and coming back[^1]. And the only way to know that is to know our product's users intimately, and listen to them.

## UX as Posture
We aren't our users! And our users aren't us. So UX requires a posture of _epistemic humility_—humility about what we know, and how we know it. It requires a _willingness to be wrong_. 

## UX as Process
Whenever we design, we make a thousand assumptions: about users, about pain points and jobs-to-be-done, about context, about business strategy, about the technology we can use. The goal of [the UX process]({{< relref "my-ux-process" >}}) is to **render those assumption visible**—and then act to test them, methodically, and intelligently.

This means that we use artifacts and deliverables and documentation to facilitate conversation, to build shared understanding, and to get our assumptions out on the table. And then we subject the riskiest assumptions to a critical evaluation.

This is a constant and iterative feedback loop between the product team and the customer—sensing and responding, trying and learning, again and again and again. We are constantly iterating and learning, checking our hypotheses, and pivoting whenever necessary.

<!-- Note to self: I think there's space for an article on making UX a "kind domain" -->

## UX as Craft
With the above in mind, we can acknowledge that UX design is about _design_, and design is a craft. As Dan Willis notes, UX is actually a wide umbrella, encompassing a variety of disciplines, tools, methods, and materials, all of which take time to master.

This idea can help make sense of some common questions people ask about UX. When someone makes a distinction between UX / UI, they are usually concerned that someone is short-changing UX as _process_. A design can't just be pretty; it has to meet a real need! But of course, the _craft_ can be short-changed, too: a product can assume everything right about the user and their goals, and _still_ be unusable because the UI design didn't apply correct principles of negative space, visual hierarchy, or color contrast and accessibility. To put it another way, a project can be well crafted in a design sense, but if the *process* of UX was ignored (i.e. little-to-no user or market assumptions were validated), it will land with a thud. Similarly, user and market assumptions can be perfectly validated and reasoned toward a solution, but if the craftmanship is poor, it, too, may land with a thud. (Though the second situation can more easily be remedied!)

This also goes to the question of "whether designers should code." My answer? Designers should _absolutely_ learn to code, or at least know enough to understand how engineers bring mockups and prototypes to life. Code is the *material* we use, and knowing the material's possibilities and constraints is a part of what makes a craftsman great. If a web designer can know something about the CSS grid, flexbox, the box model, and the many, many CSS properties available to front-end engineers—that will absolutely be helpful!

In a way, craft is the culminating side of UX design. A well-crafted product is well-made, deeply considered, beneficial, and opinionated[^2]. And that can only result from a deep understanding of user, context, material, and the business or market.

## UX as Tradition
Design as a profession started with the industrial revolution, when making things at-scale became a possibility for the first time. But people have been making tools and technology for a very long time, and design draws from pre-industrial disciplines like engineering and architecture.

Thus design a _tradition_, an unending conversation[^3]. It spans questions of business and technology, philosophy and ethics. What makes good design for print and mobile? What is the "grain of the web" and how do we design for it? What is the tension between craftsmanship and profit?[^4] What role should design and technology play in our modern life, given its' mixed-record in producing beneficial results for mankind?

Being able to contribute to the conversation means we're aware of the conversation already in progress. It helps, too, if we are [eclectic generalists]({{< relref "eclectic-generalists" >}}), capable of drawing from other fields and disciplines.

I don't know that the question of "What is UX?" will ever be easily be settled. But I think it's worth trying ot think of UX as simultaneously many things. That's my working answer, at least. And I'm proud to be part of this great profession.

[^1]: I should note here that it is not _always_ in the best interests of the company to make great products. As Ed Zitron notes in [Big Tech's Big Downgrade](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-companies-ruining-apps-websites-internet-worse-google-facebook-amazon-2023-3), many companies prioritize shareholder and investor interests, seeking short-term gains at the expense of a good product. But I think it's fair to say that any gains thus realized will result in user attrition over time. (The pull of profit is probably the biggest "distortion field" exerting force on the discipline of UX today.)

[^2]: I want to write more about how to determine whether a product is well-crafted, but for now, I like Adam Stoddard's definition in ["Craft at scale" is a white whale"](https://aaadaaam.com/notes/craft-at-scale/): 1) Is it well-made? 2) Is it well-considered? 3) Is it beneficial? 4) Is it opinionated?

[^3]: The "unending conversation" is [a wonderful metaphor used by Kenneth Burke](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/2.1/features/brent/burke.htm). It's used by him to describe philosophy and the humanities, and in the sense that design is a tradition that philosophizes about itself, I think applying the metaphor here is apt.

[^4]: "The tension between craftmanship and profit" may be among my favorite "provocative" answers to the question leading this essay.
