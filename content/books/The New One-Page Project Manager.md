title: The New One-Page Project Manager
subtitle: Communicate and Manage Any Project With A Single Sheet of Paper
description: "How to manage any project on just one piece of paper. The New One-Page Project Manager demonstrates how to efficiently and effectively communicate essential elements of a project's status. The hands of a pocket watch reveal the time of day without following every spring, cog, and movement behind the face. Similarly, an OPPM template reduces any project—no matter how large or complicated—to a simple one-page document, perfect for communicating to upper management and other project stakeholders. Now in its Second Edition, this practical guide, currently saving time and effort in thousands of organizations worldwide, has itself been simplified, then refined and extended to include the innovative AgileOPPM."
