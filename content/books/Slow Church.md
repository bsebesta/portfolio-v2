## Chapter 2: Terroir
This chapter really made me hypothesize two things: 1) that my church has adopted a "Church Growth" mindset, more than a "slow church" mindset (with *some* tempering practices that are, I suspect, largely ineffective); and 2) that my church is McDonaldized with a one-size-fits-all solution.
