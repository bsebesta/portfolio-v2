title: Temple Themes in the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood
description: "The Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood, as found in D&C 84:33-48, is an ideal focus for a scripture-based study of temple themes. These verses speak plainly about the highest blessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood. What may be less-appreciated is the clarity with which the same revelation describes the required sequence of ordinances through which individuals and families may qualify for exaltation. It is significant that this revelation was given in 1832, a decade before the Prophet began to teach many doctrines of the higher priesthood and the temple in plainness to the Saints in Nauvoo. The purpose of this book is to explore the meaning of the verses summarizing the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood in light of the ordinances required for exaltation. In matters of doctrine, the author has relied on what can be found in scripture and in statements of members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. To provide illustrations and additional background, he has drawn from a wealth of other sources. Written engagingly, and illustrated with carefully-selected images, this book is designed to encourage readers in their own study of priesthood doctrines and in their personal efforts to understand and keep their covenants."
