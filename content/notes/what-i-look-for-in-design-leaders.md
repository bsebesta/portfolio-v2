What do I look for in design leadership?

I don't believe there is any one perfect model for thinking about design leadership. But I like how David Hoang boils it down: [a design manager is a strategist, operator, and coach](https://www.beondeck.com/post/how-to-go-from-designer-to-manager).

1. Strategist
2. Operator
3. Coach
