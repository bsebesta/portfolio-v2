subtitle: A Reader's Guide to a More Tranquil Mind
description: "W. H. Auden once wrote that 'art is our chief means of breaking bread with the dead.' In his brilliant and compulsively readable new treatise, Breaking Bread with the Dead, Alan Jacobs shows us that engaging with the strange and wonderful writings of the past might help us live less anxiously in the presentâ€”and increase what Thomas Pynchon once called our 'personal density.'"
