description: "A collection of Rumi’s best, most beloved poetry—presented in one pocket-sized volume for on-the-go inspiration The renowned Persian Sufi mystic Mevlâna Jalâluddin Rumi (1207–1273) is one of the most widely read poets in the world today. His compassionate insight into the nature of human existence, his joyful humor, his deep wisdom, and his ecstatic songs of divine union have endeared him to readers for more than seven hundred years. Selected from his most-loved works, this book contains the very best of Rumi's poetry in superb translation. By turns soaring, inspiring, lyrical, entertaining, and always full of profound guidance, Rumi’s transcendent words penetrate to the very depths of one’s heart, offering eloquent expression for what lies there. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life."
