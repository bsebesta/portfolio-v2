title: Bearing God's Name
subtitle: Why Sinai Still Matters
description: "What does the Old Testament—especially the law—have to do with your Christian life? In this warm, accessible volume, Carmen Joy Imes takes readers back to Sinai, arguing that we've misunderstood the command about 'taking the Lord's name in vain.' Instead, Imes says that this command is really about 'bearing God's name,' a theme that continues throughout the rest of Scripture."
