WIP!

* From a technical and design standpoint, the goal was to start with a very simple, lightweight website (more akin to Nate Baldwin). I wanted to make the code clean and compartmentalized so I could easily iterate going forward. I wanted a playground for trying out experiments with dark mode, motion, flexbox and grid, etc.
* From a brand perspective, the goal was to be skimmable and super-clear for UX hiring managers.
* And a personal goal was to be able to easily include my *writing*: selected articles, and a digital garden. Hopefully the workflow would also encourage frequent updates as well.
* Inspiration:
    * Overall Design: Nate Baldwin, Bryant Hodson, Melvin Dinata
    * Case Studies: Melvin Dinata, Anna Larson
