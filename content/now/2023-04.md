I've launched my portfolio! Built with plain ol' vanilla HTML and CSS (and a dash of Javascript), assembled JAMstack style via Hugo, and deployed with GitHub and Netlify. It's not perfect, but it's enough for now—my MLP, most lovable product. It accomplishes a few simple goals:
 
1. The site reflects who I am and am aspiring to be
2. [It's my hot rod](https://opuszine.us/posts/opus-my-hot-rod)—a platform to learn and tinker

One of my favorite things building this was learning [Utopia's responsive type system](https://utopia.fyi/), which combined with [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) utility classes has been fantastic. The CSS still needs to be refactored, and there's still some accessibility work that needs to be done—all in time.

With the initial engineering push behind me, **I'm starting through [100 Days of Visual UI Design]({{< relref "100-days-of-learning-visual-UI" >}})**. This'll involve me spiraling back through the Shift Nudge UI design course I recently completed. It's good to get back into more visual design after so much emphasis on conversational UI.

My mental health is, all said, much better. My little war on anxiety hasn't been a _complete_ success, but I've been playing more, learning more, reading more, and all outdoors. (Spring allergies aside, the weather is doing a lot to help!) Good vibes all around.
