## The Full Story
How do you innovate products for veteran customers in a large government agency with lots of skeptical stakeholders?

RAIN was an agency specializing on multimodal design that makes use of conversational AI. We were approached by the VA about helping to lead innovation, but this was a big, government group with a lot of stakeholders; and many were skeptical of whether conversational AI could add anything. Our first task, of course, was to understand and advocate for the veteran users—but a close second task was getting stakeholder buy-in, and quickly.

Together with our PM and engineer, we drew on pre-existing research that the VA had around customer segmentation. We talked to stakeholders and subject matter experts, including pharmacists, doctors, and veterans themselves. We audited the existing ecosystem of digital apps within the healthcare space, including the IVR system.

Along the way, I was leading education, helping stakeholders understand how conversational AI works. I drew out stakeholder concerns, especially around how the safety of veterans. And drawing on our competitive audits and understanding of users, I suggested a feature set for the MVP and a roadmap that would satisfy concerns.

And the whole time, we were designing in the open. In the early stages, this meant helping everyone “visualize” a sonic experience, using aural wireframes, flow diagrams, storyboards, and scripts. As the project developed, we also incorporated voice-first prototypes and began sketching out the visual that display on smart speakers.
