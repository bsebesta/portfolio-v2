title: "Mosiah: A Brief Theological Introduction"
description: "The prophet Mormon faces the monumental task of abridging Nephite history for future generations. He looks back hundreds of years to discern God's hand amid the people's divisions and conversations. Multiple records recount multiple migrations to lands where different kings organize competing societies. A righteous monarghy ends, and a reign of judges begins."
