**As of May 2023, this journey is still in-progress and early days.**

In April 2023, having just finished watching all the course material in both [Figma Academy](https://www.figma.academy/) and [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com/), I decided that I wanted to approach visual UI design systematically and methodically. Drawing on [other examples](https://ux.shopify.com/183-days-of-hand-lettering-f4dcc8ffdeb4#.mg89gii8h) [of a 100 day challenge](https://medium.com/the-100-day-project/100-days-of-motion-design-463526af852f), I've decided to do 100 days.

## Goals
My goal was this:

1. Draft one high-fidelity mobile / web UI design daily
2. Write a short reflection on it

## Tools
My initial tool is confined to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and any associated plug-ins. A side-goal of all of this is to master Figma shortcuts (more than I already have).

## My Creative Process
My creative process is simple:
1. **Find a prompt / inspiration (10-15 minutes).** I'm looking, here, for ideas I can draw on for deciding the parameters for the day's work, or beyond. Some ideas:
    1. Copywork
    2. Coursework
    3. A novel challenge
    4. A design system or style
    <!-- 1. Copywork (e.g. copying a screen from [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/), [SaaSInterface](https://saasinterface.com/), or [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/))
    2. Coursework (e.g. [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com/), [Figma Academy](https://www.figma.academy/), or [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/))
    3. A challenge (e.g. [Designercize](https://designercize.com/) or [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/))
    4. A design system / style (e.g. [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) or [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview)).-->
2. **Setup my environment (5-10 minutes).** If it's copywork, I'd make a "mini-design-system": ID fonts, colors, and icons being used that I can set to the side. For others, I'd set the prompt (as a brief, job story, or flow) at the top.
2. **Draw the thing (30-60 minutes).** Depending on the complexity, I would take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes drawing the thing. SaaS interfaces on the web take the longest for me, since they have the most components and details.
3. **Publish to my Portfolio (20-30 minutes, once a week).** I'll share the idea out to my [UI Design Gallery](/uidesigns/) with a few nicely showcased screenshots and a short reflection.

## Days 1-14: Copywork
My goal for the first week? Copy. An unglorified form of work, but as Erik Kennedy notes, [an old tradition](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/improving-ui-design-skills-copywork/):

> Copywork is a technique that writers and painters have been using for centuries. It is the process of recreating an existing work as closely as possible in order to improve oneâ€™s skill. In our case, this means recreating a user interface (UI) design pixel for pixel.

I intentionally tried to jump around to different styles and systems (web, iOS, and Android) and do them quickly, noting how my workflow changed.

Lessons I've learned so far:
1. **Have iOS and Material Design kits handy.** I would frequently draw on toggles, buttons, bars, and switches from these two, so I made sure that I always had the Figma files with these laid out. I also made sure I had a standard artboard size for both iOS and Material Design: 390x?? for iOS, and 360x?? for Android. (These are, apparently, some of the most common resolutions out there.)
2. **Check for Design Systems.** Some websites, such as Shopify, had their own design systems that are publicly accessible. I got used to doing a quick check to see if the product had a design langauge I could draw on.
3. **Recognizing type families.** I quickly gained some fluency in identifying font stacks. For example, humanist; traditional; neogothic; geometric. I wouldn't always find a perfect fit, but I was able to keep my copied design in the same family.
5. **Finding icons.** In my copywork, I needed to quickly assess what icon set (if any) the design was using. This often took a few minutes, sometimes longer: I would find a icon system that matched closely, but not perfectly. 
4. **Recognizing type and spacing systems.** Learning to see type scales and spacing systems was helpful.
6. **Analyzing UI Designs.** Whenever I looked back over a design, I tried to 
7. **Making components early.** Following Ridd's advice, I learned to make components early and often.
8. **Essential Figma Plugins and Shortcuts.** Shortcuts, man. Use them!

This is where I'm at so far, in the middle of _more intentional copywork_.
