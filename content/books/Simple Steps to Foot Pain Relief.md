description: "Don't just treat your foot pain—strengthen your feet to prevent it. Back with an expanded edition of her popular book Every Woman's Guide to Foot Pain Relief, biomechanist Katy Bowman has created a new version for both men and women in all walks of life. With updated material and new visuals that illustrate exactly how to strengthen and mobilize your feet, Simple Steps to Foot Pain Relief will show you how to change the way you move your body to prevent pain, heal your feet, and halt damage to the rest of your body. Bowman's simple, accessible, innovative program will help you naturally address lower-leg and foot issues such as hammertoes, bunions, plantar fasciitis, poor posture and alignment. Bowman walks you gently through exercises to strengthen your feet, what shoes you should (and should not) be wearing, and how these choices affect your overall foot—and whole-body!—health. Simple Steps to Foot Pain Relief will teach you how healthy feet work optimally and help you put your best foot forward on the path toward moving with greater ease."
