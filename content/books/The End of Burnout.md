Burnout, Malesic argues, originates in the gap between our ideals for work and the reality of the job. Burnout has three dimensions, each of which can be thought of as a spectrum.

1. We hold on to the ideals *and* compromised realities for dear life. We're thus **overextended** and **exhausted**.
2. We've abandoned our ideals and submit to the compromised reality. We've **depersonalized** our coworkers and clients, and are **cynical**.
3. We ignore or rebel against the reality while maintaining our ideals. We become disappointed or angry becuase our work doesn't measure up to our expectations; we feel **ineffective** and **worthless**. We are **frustrated**. (This is the most common one, apparently.)

Alternatively, we can let go of both ideal and reality; the reality of work and our ideals go flying apart. And when *that* happens, well, that's *true* burnout. 

Our cultural conversation focuses almost entirely on exhaustion, and so people who are "only" overextended are likely overcounted. This is in part because exhaustion is the "noble" excess. It's noble to work too hard! But to feel ineffective, that's nothing to be proud of or admit. But the most common profile is the frustrated.

The book contains a lot more than this, but this is my biggest takeaway. It's a wonderful read from a former academic who was himself burned out, and wanted to understand what it means. I recommend it to anyone worried about burnout in themselves or in their friends.
