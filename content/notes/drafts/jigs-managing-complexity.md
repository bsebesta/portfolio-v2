Design challenges in the modern world are complex. They draw on assumptions about users, context, materials, business needs, the market, and the competitive environment. A strong designer has to keep a lot of things in their head at once, [zooming in and zooming out]({{< relref "levels-of-10" >}}) depending on the conversation or the needs.

One concept that's been really helpful for me to _name_ is the idea of a jigs. In his book [The World Outside Your Head](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Beyond_Your_Head/uyilBAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), Matt Crawford refers to a jig as

> a device or procedure that guides a repeated action by constraining the environment in such a way as to make the action go smoothly, the same each time, without having to think about it... A jig reduces the degrees of freedom that are afforded by the environment.

Basically, it's an acknowledgement that human beings are limited—we can only do so much at a time, only attend to so much at a time. And even that limited attention can be easily derailed. [As Brian Dijkame notes](https://comment.org/editorial-cultural-jigs/), commenting on the same book:

> Crawford further notes that “to keep action on track, according to some guiding purpose, one has to keep attention properly directed.” You need a jig. Sometimes it means blocking something out; sometimes it means putting something in place so you notice it (like my habit of placing my keys and wallet in a small basket by our front door). **Put differently, a jig is something that constrains our attention to keep us on the right track to act toward some guiding purpose. We offload some responsibility and attention onto a jig, not in order to be irresponsible, but precisely in order to focus our agency, to free it to take responsibility for what matters.**

[As Alan Jacobs puts it](https://blog.ayjay.org/movie-cards/), and in a way that might resonate more with designers, jigs are "the improvisations, the invented methods and practices" that we rig-up and lay down to be more creative. They focus us, move us, direct us aright so that we can focus.

What are examples of jigs?

* When I cook, I like to take a couple of minutes to get out the bowls, spoons, and bread and place them on the counter in an order that matches the sequence I'll be using them in. It takes a bit more time up-front, but it means that I have everything on hand, and can focus less on the fun details of cooking—flavor, fat, acid, heat.
* Daily routines are jigs. In his wonderful book _Daily Rituls_, Mason Currey chronicles the lives of artists and creatives, and the different routines they adopted to focus them on their creative work.
* A design system is a jig. We make decisions regarding color, type, spacing, and component design up front so that we can direct our attention to the pages and flows that solve real customer needs. The same goes for brand guides and style guides—we make these decisions once, and they propogate.
* Frameworks are jigs. A SWOT exercise, Jobs-to-be-Done, personas and journey maps—these "frame our work" so that we're asking the right questions (assuming the method we've chosen is the right method).

To that last point: the designer Tommy Geoco [has a long list of jigs he uses](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7029433865358217216?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7029433865358217216%29). These include the basic ideas and principles he references regularly, a variety of decision frameworks he employs, and processes for weighing information. By having these, he can _move fast_—allowing him to practice what he calls "warp-speed UX design."

It's worth it, I think, to consider the jigs we use—as both designers and as _people_. As someone who struggles with attention generally, I've adopted an "ambient jig" of a internet blocking app. During the key hours of my productivity, which are mainly the mornings and mid-afternoons, I block myself from YouTube, streaming websites, and a variety of news websites—"not in order to be irresponsible, but precisely in order to focus [my] agency, to free it to take responsibility for what matters." It's, again, strategic attentiveness.

It's also worth it, I think, to consider that the end-products we design often act as jigs for people, and it is this fact of directing attention that allows us to design not just a product, but an _experience_. For what determines experience, if not attention?
