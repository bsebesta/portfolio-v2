## A Little Context
My name is Bryan. By trade, I'm a people-centered designer who writes and codes. By vocation, I'm an (amateur) anthropologist and philosopher of technology. By hobby, I'm a bibliophile and tinkerer.

I've spent the last five years at [RAIN Agency](https://rain.agency/), a pioneer in conversational AI. There, I've honed my UX and conversational UI design skills—leading projects for 20+ clients like Headspace, Wynn Resorts, Autotrader, Nike, Nestlé, and US Veterans' Affairs.

In January, I was laid off due to business restructuring. I'm looking for product design work that meets a real need, wherever that takes me.

My strengths include [intellection](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252284/intellection-theme.aspx#:~:text=People%20exceptionally%20talented%20in%20the,Intellection%2C%20are%20strongest%20in%20them), gathering insight, systems thinking, and solving problems. I love working with big ideas and challenging projects that help people.

I work best when I'm championing human-centered experiences with a supportive, empathetic, and passionate team—where we're regularly interacting with users in tight design-build feedback loops.

My dreams include hiking the Appalaichan Trail, teaching at a university, and one day traveling outside the United States. For now, though, I just enjoy spending time with my family, running, and reading good books.

## A Little History
My interest in technology and design started as a kid growing up in California. When my parents saw me tinkering with code on MySpace and Neopets, they got me Microsoft Frontpage for a present. Within a year I had learned enough code to launch a reference website about LEGO Bionicle that was (for a while) the largest of its kind. It even earned me correspondence with the author of the Bionicle books!

Later, I was fortunate to attend a High School with an incredible computer program, and became the captain of the Varsity Web Team (really!), teaching web design to peers and junior classmen, and becoming known by my teachers as the kid to ask about computer problems.

I attended college in Utah. After changing my plans *many* times (History major? Instructional Designer?), I discovered UX and became president of the nascent UX club. After graduation, I got a UX research job doing field research and interviews for the award-winning Day One App.

From there, I took a job with RAIN Agency, which took me to New York City—a city I absolutely love. I hope to go back one day.

As Wendell Berry says, "We live the given life, not the planned." I've been helped by [many people]({{< relref "acknowledgements" >}}), and the best parts of my history have been surprising graces. I've been a club president and marketing director; an adjunct at a university, teaching UX and conversational design; a presenter at an artisanal chocolate shop, leading twice-a-month chocolate tastings for groups of 30 people; an instructional designer for an IT company; a Sunday School teacher for teens; and more. I'm also a husband and parent.
