This book is very short, but powerful. It shows how family worship is discussed in the Bible and in church history—especially in the reformed tradition. And then it discusses what family worship should really consist of, which, spoiler alert, is "reading, praying, singing." The value in this book comes in the strong encouragement to family worship, and in the concrete practices he suggests to make it happen in a not-tedious way. And It's really changed my own approach to "spiritual leadership in the home." I'd recommend this book to anyone looking to better understand what family worship is and how to do it.
