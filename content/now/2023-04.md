I've launched my portfolio! Built with plain ol' vanilla HTML and CSS (and a dash of Javascript), assembled JAMstack style via Hugo, and deployed with GitHub and Netlify. It's not perfect, but it's enough for now.

In building this, I've been thinking of a line from the Bhagavad Gita: "To action alone hast thou a right and never at all to its fruits; let not the fruits of action be thy motive..." Whether this new portfolio nets me the fruit of some terrific opportunity or job, I can't say. But two things:
 
1. The site reflects who I am and am aspiring to be
2. For the past month, I've been genuinely, enjoyably lost in *building it*—the design, coding, and writing of this little spot on the internet I call home.

The next challenge is systematically updating my visual UI design skills. I've already finished [Figma Academy](https://www.figma.academy/). I've got two courses I'm using to level up—[Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com/) by MDS and [Learn UI Design](https://www.learnui.design/) by Erik Kennedy. Time to go to work.
