title: Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist and Other Essays
description: "Offers a collection of non-fiction essays exploring the state of the world as ecosystems, economies and assumptions collapse around us. Kingnorth's essays chart the change in his thinking as he grew disenchanted with the environmental movement he once embraced and articulate a new vision, one that stands firmly in opposition to the belief that technology can save us. He argues for a renewed balance between the human and nonhuman worlds."
