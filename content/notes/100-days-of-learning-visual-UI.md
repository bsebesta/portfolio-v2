In early 2023, I decided that I wanted to approach visual UI design systematically and methodically. Drawing on [other examples](https://ux.shopify.com/183-days-of-hand-lettering-f4dcc8ffdeb4#.mg89gii8h) [of the 100 day challenge](https://medium.com/the-100-day-project/100-days-of-motion-design-463526af852f), I'm documenting my experience here.

## Goals, Rules, Tools
My goal was this:

1. Draft one high-fidelity mobile / web UI design daily
2. Write a short reflection on it

The only _rule_, per s√©, is this: if I miss a day, or two, just pick it up and do it again the next day!

My initial tool is confined to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and any associated plug-ins.

## My Creative Process
My creative process is simple:
1. **Look for inspiration (10-15 minutes).** I'm looking, here, for ideas I can draw on for deciding the parameters for that day's work. It can be:
    1. Copywork (e.g. copying a screen from [Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/), [SaaSInterface](https://saasinterface.com/), or [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/))
    2. Coursework (e.g. [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com/), [Figma Academy](https://www.figma.academy/), or [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/))
    3. A challenge (e.g. [Designercize](https://designercize.com/) or [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/)); 4. A design system / style (e.g. [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) or [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview)).
2. **Setup my environment (5-10 minutes).** I'd copy the screens into Figma, setup the artboards, and do a quick icon system check.
2. **Draw the thing (30-60 minutes).** Depending on the complexity, I would take anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes drawing the thing. SaaS interfaces on the web took the longest for me, being more complex, icon-rich, and having a wider variety of fonts fonts.
3. **Publish to my Portfolio (20-30 minutes).** I'll share the idea out to my [UI Design Gallery](/uidesigns/) with a few nicely showcased screenshots and a short reflection.

## Days 1-14: Copywork
My goal for the first week? Just do copywork! I intentionally tried to jump around to different styles and systems (web, iOS, and Android), to get a sense of what UI design actually entails.

Some of the things I learned quickly in this process.

1. **Have iOS and Material Design kits handy.** I would frequently draw on toggles, buttons, bars, and switches from these two, so I made sure that I always had the Figma files with these laid out. I also made sure I had a standard artboard size for both iOS and Material Design: 390x?? for iOS, and 360x?? for Android. (These are, apparently, some of the most common resolutions out there.)
2. **Check for Design Systems.** Some websites, such as Shopify, had their own design systems that are publicly accessible. I got used to doing a quick check to see if the product had a design langauge I could draw on.
3. **Recognizing type families.** I quickly gained some fluency in identifying font stacks. For example, humanist; traditional; neogothic; geometric. I wouldn't always find a perfect fit, but I was able to keep my copied design in the same family.
5. **Finding icons.** In my copywork, I needed to quickly assess what icon set (if any) the design was using. This often took a few minutes, sometimes longer: I would find a icon system that matched closely, but not perfectly. 
4. **Recognizing type and spacing systems.** Learning to see type scales and spacing systems was helpful.
6. **Analyzing UI Designs.** Whenever I looked back over a design, I tried to 
7. **Making components early.** Following Ridd's advice, I learned to make components early and often.
8. **Essential Figma Plugins and Shortcuts.**
