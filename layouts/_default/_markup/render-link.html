<a href="{{ .Destination | safeURL }}"{{ with .Title}} title="{{ . }}"{{ end }}{{ if strings.HasPrefix .Destination "http" }} target="_blank"{{ end }}>{{ .Text | markdownify }}</a><!--
    This is the code that controls the "target" attribute for links in Goldmark.
    If a link has "http" as the prefix, it will open in a new tab.
    If it's an internal link, it will open in the same tab.

    For reference, see:
    https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-open-link-in-new-tab-with-hugos-new-goldmark-markdown-renderer-in-v0-62-0/22540/2

    One note: I had to change `.Text | safeURL` to `.Text | markdownify` to keep
    it from changing inline quotes to HTML name codes.
