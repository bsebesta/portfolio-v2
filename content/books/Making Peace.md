title: "Making Peace: Personal Essays"
description: "At a time when society has become so violent that school children conceal weapons in their waistbands, Eugene England suggests that everyone take a moment to reconsider where they stand on issues. Using his hallmark literary forms of personal essay and autobiographical short story, he draws examples from his own life to illustrate the complexities people face at home, in their neighborhoods, at work, and in the pews. Admitting to no easy answers, he shows through plot and metaphor of well developed stories, and through the penetrating view of his unrelenting mind, the dangers and advantages of various options.He takes readers on road trips to present the Christian ethic in a new and seductive light. He recounts the times when inner tranquility and outward peace have come to his own family and community in unusual ways. Whether traipsing through Utah's trout streams, visiting strife-torn Los Angeles, or sorting out the cultural maze he encountered on a church mission to American Samoa, England proposes paths people might follow to reconcile ambiguities in maintaining a caring, purposeful existence in the 1990s and beyond."
