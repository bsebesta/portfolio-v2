Gonna try a different format for this month, emoji-style.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Job Search.** So far, three full interview processes ending in rejection and _lots_ of applications without hearing a word. Which is, let's be honest, depressing. At the same time, I've never felt better about my own _growth_: I'm learning and designing every day, for things I'm really passionate about, and my portfolio's shape has reduced my imposter syndrome _quite a lot_ (though not entirely, alas). My consolation and comfort this month comes from Krishna's words in the Bhagavad Gita:

> Let your concern (or focus) be on your action,  
> let it not be on the outcome of the action.  
> Do not act only out of expectation of a result,  
> but then do not slip into inactivity.

Great words, holy words.

üë®‚Äçüíª **Work.** I'm currently continuing to focus on my "100 Days" of visual UI learning. Every morning, I'm in [Shift Nudge](https://shiftnudge.com/) (working through it a second time, focusing on each homework assignment), and then I'm working on some longer-term web/mobile case studies in the late morning or afternoon. A fun side-effect: my Figma shortcut is _ace_ right now, and that's nice.

üß† **Memory.** I've dusted off my SRS (spaced repetition system), and working to create what Tom Geoco calls "information scaffold" that allows designers to operate fast. Using [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/), I'm making SRS prompts for the following, memorizing about 10 prompts a day:

* UI Components and Screen Patterns (drawing initially from [Mobbin's fabulous dictionary](https://mobbin.com/dictionary))
* Principles of Behavioral Psychology (drawing from Geoco's list and [CogLode's incredible behavioral design cookbook](https://www.coglode.com/cookbook))
* Atomic Design principles (drawing from Brad Frost's book)
* Usability Heuristics (e.g. [Jakob Nielsen's list](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/))
* Design Systems
* Business Terms
* Etc...

Probably the most interesting challenge here is crafting the prompts so that I can recall what I need on the basis of use case. For example, it's a good thing for me to have the 48 UI components from Mobbin's list memorized, and the 100+ screen patterns too. But am I memorizing this in such a way that I recall it, when I need it? That's the big test.

üõù **Play.** The worst part of Spring (allergies) seems to be largely over, so I'm taking advantage of the weather with some hiking, running, and the occasional swim. I'm also playing around with Procreate‚Äînothing fancy, but just trying my hand at the occasional illustration. Good things for the soul, all.

üìö **Books.** I'm also reading some great stuff:
* [Closing the Loop: Systems Thinking for Designers (2023)](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/systems-thinking-for-designers/) by Sheryl Cababa: Wonderful.
* [Right Ho, Jeeves (1934)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Ho,_Jeeves) by PG Wodehouse: Vintage hilarity.
* [Making Design Decisions: How to design effective user interfaces at warp-speed (2023)](https://designertom.gumroad.com/l/workbook) by Tom Geoco: Terrific guide on how to work quickly at great design.
