title: A Little Context
---

I'm Bryan. I'm a people-centered designer with 5+ years of experience in UX.

Most recently, I've led UX and conversational UI design at [RAIN Agency](https://www.rain.agency/) in New York City. I led product strategy and design with 20+ clients, including Headspace, Wynn Resorts, Autotrader, Nike, Nestl√©, Amazon, Suffolk Construction, and US Veterans' Affairs.

I'm currently looking to shift to web and mobile product design in a SaaS company. And, I'm open to relocation. If you're interested in working, drop me a line [over email](mailto:hello@bryansebesta.com) or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryansebesta).

My strengths (and favorite parts of UX) include strategy, managing or reducing complexity, and research. I especially love being out in the field, talking to real people and validating assumptions.

When I'm not designing, you can find me reading, hiking, reading, snacking on artisanal chocolate, reading, tinkering with code, and reading.
