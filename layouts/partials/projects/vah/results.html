                <h3>Success: Time on Task</h3>
                <p>Relative to the automated voice system, we reduced time-on-task by nearly 400%</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Success: Accessibility Improvements</h3>
                <p>Differently abled users we tested with unanimously expressed pleasure with the experience, saying "I don't see how you could make it any easier” and “How easy is that... If it works like that... God, yeah, please.”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Failure: It Never Shipped</h3>
                <p>Just as we were about to launch, the entire Amazon team working on regulatory medical voice applications was laid off. We could no longer launch on consumer-facing smart speakers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Success: Rewrote Digital Strategy</h3>
                <p>In spite of that, we built the groundwork for a comprehensive multimodal / conversational UI strategy that the VA could incorporate in building chatbots, IVRs, and multimodality in their mobile apps</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
