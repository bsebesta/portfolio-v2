What do I look for in design leadership?

I don't believe there is any one perfect model for thinking about design leadership. But I like how David Hoang boils it down: [a design manager is a strategist, operator, and coach](https://www.beondeck.com/post/how-to-go-from-designer-to-manager). So my current model of looking for things in design leadership involves asking questions like:

1. **Strategist.** How do you help the team meet business goals? OKRs, or something else?
2. **Operator.** How do you help the team run effectively? What are team rituals? How do you run critiques and facilitate feedback? How do you handle burnout?
3. **Coach.** Do you hold 1-on-1s? How often? What investments do you make in facilitating career development? Is there a progression framework the team uses?

When I'm interviewed, I usually ask some variations of the above questions.
