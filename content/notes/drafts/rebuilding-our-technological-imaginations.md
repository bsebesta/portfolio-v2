Today's technological imagination is sterile, and we need to rebuild it.

What does "sterile" here mean? Literally, it can mean lacking in imagination, excitement, or insight; it can also mean incapable of producing offspring. And here, we arrive at this: the current technological imagination imagines a world without friction, a world where there is no contingency, serendipity, or trouble; everything is optimised and efficient, and everyone follows pre-determined paths. This is the [[McDonaldization]] of everything.

There are a few core ideas fundamental to expanding this vision:

* **Expanding our Idea of Technology.** [[What is technology?]] This question needs to be answered before anything else.
* **Realizing that Technology is Moral.** [[Discerning technologies' moral valence requires interrogation]]
* **Acknowledging an Anthropology.** We can't just have a sophisticated view of technology; we also need a comprehensive *anthropology*: a vision of human flourishing and purpose that can inform one's technological critique.

Here are some principles that have occurred to me in my reading:

* **Desirable Friction.** Distinguishing between "benevolent troubles" ([[Many human limits are benevolent inducements to flourishing]]) and "malevolent troubles" ([[Some human limits are inevitable evils we accept but pray will one day end]]), and promoting the former while eradicating the latter.
* **Increasing Skill and Proper Powers.** Focusing on devices that engage the whole human, and augment our powers, rather than replace them or diminish us. (See [[Convivial tools allow individuals to enrich the world]], [[Device paradigm and focal practices]], [[Pleasure at being the cause]]). Andy Crouch draws a distinction between [[Proper powers and Superpowers]], and how technology can give power without effort that diminishes us (especially when motivated by money and Mammon). Another way of putting this is trying to create holistic technologies that promote autonomy, mastery, and self-control, rather than prescriptive ones technologies that contribute to a culture of compliance ([[Prescriptive and Holistic technologies]]). One can also look at this on a *community* level. I can try to find traditions that modern liberal culture has unsettled and talents its deskilled, and helping people and communities learn those skills that might have been lost.
	* Related: [[Simplicity as spiritual discipline]], see especially the Talia Barnes bit
* **Agency-strengthening Technology.** I can focus on projects that help people pursue their [[Second-order desires are desires about desires|Second-order desires]], and *not* their first-order desires (or "revealed preferences"). See [[Revealed preferences is a problematic theory]].
* **Investing in Calm Technology.** [[Calm Technology]] is any technology designed *not* to compete for our attention. 
	* Note: so many of my key ideas fall into the buckets above! Our bodies need movement to keep from wasting away; we need to be tested to improve and enhance our memory; we need to be challenged in deliberate practice to grow our skills, with the right scaffolding coming at the right moments. 
* **"Slow" Technology.** Here I think about Helprin's 1996 article "The Acceleration of Tranquility," and the impact that slowing can have. Does our technology overconnect us? Or can it have a decelerating effect?
* **Repair and Maintenance.** Resisting the "innovation delusion" (i.e. our obsession with the new and novel), and focusing instead on on "the values of care, mending, maintenance and restoration", long cherished in the mechanical arts but written out of the current technological imagination (see [[Maintenance and Repair]], as well as Vallor, Vinsel, Chachra, and Jacobs).
* **"Just" technology.** Recognizing that time-saving technology can increase unhealthy expectations (i.e. how wives are now expected to upkeep a home because of vacuum cleaners, etc). [[Central to any new technology is the concept of justice]]; see also the ideas of positive peace or "justpeace." See also ideas of health: relationships, movement, nutrition, meaning. How can technology foster this?
* **Building out Inclusion.** Focusing on technology that is inclusive and accessible, that meets people where their bodies are. See [[Designs should be accessible]].
* **A Holistic View of Learning.** One lens to look at all of this is technology that helps us *learn*, in the holistic, embodied sense of the word! If we assume that human beings are made to *learn*, how does technology help us memorize knowledge? Learn skills? Build habits? And orient our loves and desires?
* **Strengthening Relationships.** How can we build technology that genuinely fosters relationship? That builds households, not just homes?

Much of this is about undoing [[Value collapse]] and mistaken anthropologies ([[Many anthropologies are mistaken or incomplete]]), regaining the moral and ethical sight to see that too much convenience can be bad for us. (I also think of ). This is also about tackling the root challenges of what has undone so many institutions, traditions, and other things worth conserving (see [[Conservatism failed because it didn't address technological roots of change]]).
