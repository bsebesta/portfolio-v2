What is my UX process?

The answer: I have a process, and I don't. It depends. Like Schrödinger's cat, it's both at once. Let me explain.

## I have a process...
Broadly speaking, when I'm approaching a new product or flow in a relatively stable environment, my process looks something like the following[^1].

1. Understand the problem
2. Determine the nature of the complexity—how, and how much
3. Use the appropriate tools (content maps, flows, lists) to guide the conversation and render assumptions visible
4. Wireframe (if appropriate)
5. Set design direction
6. Present early, present often
7. Explore, ship, iterate
8. Systematize

Seems neat, right? Granted, there's nuance: I might want to set

## ... But also, there's no process
But here's the thing: never has a project I've worked on gone from discovery, to brainstorming, to sketching, to testing, to ship in perfect order.

Now, I think it's useful to have a rough process to follow. The process itself is a [jig]({{< relref "jigs-managing-complexity.md" >}}), a tool for managing the daunting complexity of building design. And again, in stable or safe situations, the process can be followed.

But our modern world moves faster.

Part of this is diagnosed eloquently by Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, in his excellent article [Welcome to the WIP](https://www.figma.com/blog/welcome-to-the-wip/)—one of the most important articles.

> Products today never get built in such a clear, linear, and picture-perfect way. The reality is so much messier. So why do we act like it isn’t?
> 
> Well, for a long time, this was the process. Back when product design meant physical products, it was materially important that everyone follow a carefully constructed, linear process. As the world became increasingly digital, the spaces we designed for became faster to build and iterate on. Product teams can ship an update in a matter of minutes versus leaving their users stuck with a design for years to come. Today, every digital product is a work in progress. And this has changed how we design.

Yamashita historicizes design. 

In his book [The Art of Action]({{< relref "The Art of Action" >}}), Stephen Bungay describes this same phenomenon in slightly different words. He calls it "legacy thinking,"  and it has three main attributes:

1. It's possible to know all you need to know to be able to plan what to do
2. Planners and doers should be separated
3. There's only one right way to do things (or, "There's the Process!")

Bungay makes the same point Yamashita does: we live in a complex, fast-moving, unpredictable environment. The old way of thinking assumes... we don't. So the longer we persist in this waterfall-like approach, the faster things break down.

## We Need a New Approach
So in an ideal world, there's less a _linear process_ and more of a _system of recurring practices_ that help usher products into the future. As Yamashita outlines it, this includes:

1. Reviewing work at a predictable cadence versus the perfect moment
2. Considering the form feedback takes as much as the feedback itself
3. Be less precious about the work that ships

And within this frame, we're constantly approaching the process more like a toolbox than a

I'm still noodling on this. But I look forward to working.

**In a relatively stable environment**, I generally draw on a process: understand the problem, determine complexity, use the appropriate tools, wireframe (if appropriate), set design direction, present often, explore/ship/iterate, and systematize.

But I've never been in a project that follows that perfectly; "relatively stable environments" are rare and often manufactured. I believe that our modern design environment is complex, fast-moving, and unpredictable. That fact, together with the reality of how we can get design feedback asynchronously in teams anytime from nearly anyone anywhere, means **that any strict process breaks down**. It's either impossible, or if possible, not desirable because it works against the grain of our how things really are.

Rather, it's about the systems we use—things like regular design reviews, the forms our feedback takes, the willingness to ship "good enough" products continuously.
