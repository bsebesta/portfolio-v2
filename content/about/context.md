title: A Little Context
---

I'm Bryan. I'm a people-centered designer with 7 years of experience in UX.

Most recently, I've led UX and conversational UI design at [RAIN Agency](https://www.rain.agency/) in New York City. I led product strategy and design with 20+ clients, including Headspace, Wynn Resorts, Autotrader, Nike, Nestl√©, Amazon, Suffolk Construction, and US Veterans' Affairs.

I'm currently looking to shift to web and mobile product design in a SaaS company. I'm open to relocation. If you're interested in working together, drop me a line [over email](mailto:hello@bryansebesta.com) or [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryansebesta).

My strengths (and favorite parts of UX) include strategy, managing or reducing complexity, and research. I especially love being out in the field, talking to real people and validating assumptions.

If you are what you love, then I'm a book, hiking shoes, and artisanal chocolate. I dearly love the outdoors, and hope to one day hike the entire Appalachian Trail.
