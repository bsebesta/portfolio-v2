description: "Profound without being 'stuffy,' Wright's guide to the first half of Matthew's Gospel moves passage by passage through his own easy-to-understand translation of the original text. Writing in an approachable and anecdotal style, he captures the excitement of Scripture and provides background information, explanations, and applications. Also includes a glossary of crucial terms."
