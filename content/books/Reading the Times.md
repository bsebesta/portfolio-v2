title: Reading the Times
subtitle: A Literary and Theological Inquiry into the News
description: "When we read the news, we are not merely informedâ€”we're also formed. In this refreshing call to put the news in its place, Jeffrey Bilbro helps us gain a theological and historical perspective on the nature and very purpose of news. Offering an alternative vision of the rhythms of life, he suggests thoughtful practices for media consumption in order cultivate healthier ways of reading and being."
