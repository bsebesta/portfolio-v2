## To you, what is UX?
[I think "UX" design is actually five different things]({{< relref "what-is-ux" >}}), all at once:

* **A fact**: users experience design or said another way, design + context = experience
* **A principle**: we should be obsessed with the customer
* **A process** of making assumptions visible, and then testing them rigorously
* **A craft**, drawing on many disciplines (UI design, information architecture, content strategy, behavioral psychology, etc)
* **A tradition**, stretching back centuries, that invites us to consider the past/future and think ethically about our work

## What is your UX process?
[Here's my long answer]({{< relref "my-ux-process" >}}), but in short:

In a relatively stable environment, I usually follow a process like this: understand the problem, determine complexity, use the appropriate tools, wireframe (if appropriate), set design direction, present often, explore/ship/iterate, and systematize.

But I've never been in a project that follows that perfectly, as "relatively stable environments" are rare and often manufactured. I believe that our modern design environment is complex, fast-moving, and unpredictable. That fact, together with the reality of how we can get design feedback asynchronously in teams anytime from nearly anyone anywhere, means _that any strict process breaks down_.

In other words, we need to drop this "legacy thinking" or "manufacturing mindest", and instead adopt a new perspective of _continuous deployment_: everything's a WIP. This mean adopting processes like like regular design reviews, and making cultural shifts rethinking the forms our feedback takes and being willing to ship "good enough" products regularly.

## What's your greatest strength(s)?
I most enjoy the idea work and the people work. With ideas, it's the big picture stuff that I'm great atâ€”things like UX or content strategy, getting a handle on the complexity, plotting out design systems, or diagramming and deciding on flows. I can really get into all of that.

I also love the people work, like field research or mentorship or coaching. I started my UX career doing contextual interviews for the [Day One Journal app](https://dayoneapp.com/), and I've had lots of opportunity to get good at usability testing.

## What's my greatest weakness?
Spring allergies, probably.

But my _other_ greatest weakness? As mentioned above, I'm natively an ideas guy, not a "details person." Getting past the big ideas and conversations to actually *doing* polished high-fidelity screens, to detailed quantitative analysis, or to final drafts can be difficult for me. But I've found tricks, reframes, and [jigs]({{< relref "jigs-managing-complexity.md" >}}) that help me get into it. And it's so much easier if the big picture stuff's in place and there's a regular cadence of showing things with users.

If there's one part of the technical work I DO enjoy, it's coding. I can get lost in code for hours, and I wonder if I should have been a developer. But design is still worthwhile to me. I don't aspire to be merely an academic, or a technician. Instead, I want to be a craftsman-philosopher: building the right things, in the right way, with a product that's both good-looking and functional.

## What's the part of the UX process I enjoy the most/least?
I enjoy qualitative research where I actually interact with users most, followed closely by working with design systems. I enjoy quantitative analysis the least.
