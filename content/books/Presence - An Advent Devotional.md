title: "Presence: An Advent Devotional"
description: "It is impossible to love at a distance. Only in intimate community do we learn the needs of another and know how to act for their good. We offer love as we come to know the object of our love, and we receive love as we open our hearts to another, believing our deepest hopes and fears are held with great care and respect. Advent is the glorious celebration of God’s nearness to those he loves. Though we are weak and weary from the sickness of sin, our Lord does not despise our lowliness but instead dignifies our humanity with the gift of his presence. He loves us at our worst and proves that love to be true by taking our very life upon himself, entering our death so that we might know his life. As a companion to the Presence plan in the Dwell app, this book is a faithful guide through the Advent season, inviting you to be present to God through daily time in Scripture and formative practices that invite you deeper into the wonder of God’s presence with us in Jesus."
