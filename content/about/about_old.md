My love for design began with LEGOs. I grew up building ships, castles, space shuttles, forts, and whatever else I could manage. I loved seeing how these interlocking systems came apart and together.

That same love for design carried over into another discipline I discovered at an early. At age 11, I taught myself to code, and by age 14, I was running the largest LEGO Bionicle reference site. All this pushed me forward in technology: by age 18, I was “captain of the varsity web team” at my high school, leading developing on our High Schools’ website and teaching incoming Freshmen and Sophomores how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Over my lifetime, the materials I've designed with have changed: from LEGOs, to code, to visual UI and conversational UI. But throughout it all, I have carried with me a love of *the promise of design—to build something that meets a need for one, or many, human beings.*

I'm a big believer in drawing inspiration from the past. The great designer Charles Eames often advised "innovate as a last resort", concerned that to innovate too much, too fast would cause us to lose the wisdom of the development up to that point.

Design is many things. It's "the rendering of intent." It's "intelligence made visible." It's "a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose."

I also believe in understanding the ethical implications of design. As Melvin Kranzberg once wrote, "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral."

## More Thoughts
All technology changes how we experience space, time, community; how we relate to the world. We need to design with people in mind, but then, we also need to expand our idea of people—including the deaf and blind, the differently abled, children and the elderly. We need to make a world that is more humane.
