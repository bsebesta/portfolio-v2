title: Zen to Done
subtitle: The Ultimate Simple Productivity System
description: "Zen To Done is a simple system to help you get organized and productive--keeping your life saner and less stressed--with a set of simple habits. Zen To Done takes some of the best aspects of popular productivity systems (GTD, Stephen Covey, and others), then combines and simplifies them, giving you just what you need--and no more. Simply put, ZTD teaches you: (1) The key habits needed to be organized and productive. (2) How to implement these habits. (3) How to organize the habits into a simple system that will keep everything in your life in its place. (4) How to simplify what you need to do. (5) How to implement an even simpler version called Minimal ZTD. If you're tired of doing things the hard way and just want a simple, easy, yet effective way to accomplish your goals, Zen To Done is just what you need."
