title: "Thor: The Saga Of Gorr The God Butcher"
description: "A trail of blood consumes Thor's past, present and future! Gods are vanishing across the ages, and Thor must unravel the gruesome mystery of Gorr the God Butcher! In the distant past, Thor discovers a cave echoing with the cries of tortured gods! In the present, Thor follows the bloody wake of murdered gods across the depths of space. And millennia from now, the last god-king of Asgard makes his final stand against Gorr's berserker legions. As Thors from three eras race to stop Gorr, his scheme's full extent is revealed: What is the Godbomb? At the end of time, the universe's remaining gods are enslaved, building a machine that will forever change the face of creation. Three time-bending Thors unite, but will it all be for naught as the massive Godbomb is triggered? (Collects Thor: God of Thunder #1-11)"
