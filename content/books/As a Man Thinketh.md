title: As a Man Thinketh
description: "As A Man Thinketh maps out the way in which our thoughts can affect our physical, mental, emotional and social health. It also discusses ways in which we can use our visions and ideas to lead us to peace of mind. This book by James Allen sums up the hows, whys and whats of taming the mind and its infinite energies, of channelizing the power of positive thinking, and striking a balance between the inner world of our thoughts as against the outer world of action."
