title: The God Who Weeps
subtitle: How Mormonism Makes Sense of Life
description: "'Whether by design or by chance,' Terryl and Fiona Givens write, 'we find ourselves in a universe filled with mystery. We encounter appealing arguments for a Divinity that is a childish projection, for prophets as scheming or deluded imposters, and for scripture as so much fabulous fiction. But there is also compelling evidence that a glorious Divinity presides over the cosmos, that His angels are strangers we have entertained unawares, and that His word and will are made manifest through a sacred canon that is never definitively closed. What we choose to embrace, to be responsive to, is the purest reflection of who we are and what we love. That is why faith, the choice to believe, is in the final analysis, an action that is positively laden with moral significance.' As humans, we are, like the poet John Keats, 'straining at particles of light in the midst of a great darkness.' And yet, the authors describe a version of life's meaning that is reasonableâ€”and radically resonant. It tells of a God whose heart beats in sympathy with ours, who set His heart upon us before the world was formed, who fashioned the earth as a place of human ascent, not exile, and who has the desire and the capacity to bring the entire human family home again."
