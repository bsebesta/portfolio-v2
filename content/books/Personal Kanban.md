title: Personal Kanban
subtitle: "Mapping Work | Navigating Life"
description: "Machines need to be productive. People need to be effective. Productivity books focus on doing more, Jim and Tonianne want you to focus on doing better. Personal Kanban is about choosing the right work at the right time. Recognizing why we do the things we do. Understanding the impact of our actions. Creating value - not just product. For ourselves, our families, our friends, our co-workers. For our legacy. Personal Kanban takes the same Lean principles from manufacturing that led the Japanese auto industry to become a global leader in quality, and applies them to individual and team work. Personal Kanban asks only that we visualize our work and limit our work-in-progress. Visualizing work allows us to transform our conceptual and threatening workload into an actionable, context-sensitive flow. Limiting our work-in-progress helps us complete what we start and understand the value of our choices. Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives. Neither a prescription nor a plan, Personal Kanban provides a light, actionable, achievable framework for understanding our work and its context. This book describes why students, parents, business leaders, major corporations, and world governments all see immediate results with Personal Kanban."

It talks about using the Kanban philosophy for one's personal life. Oliver Burkeman alluded to it in "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals," one of my *favorite* books, so I thought I'd check it out. Basically, this approach can help someone embrace *limits*: we can't do it all, so what *can* we do? I use a personal kanban now, or at least at the time of writing (2022).
