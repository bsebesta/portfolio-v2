The goal here was pretty simple: recreate a couple of the "Create an Account" screens for Expedia, taking my cue from [these screenshots on Mobbin](https://mobbin.com/apps/expedia-ios-d74936eb-9c7c-47e3-b9dc-e4905935bf46/9181a751-c171-450a-906d-0f58ddbc632b/screens).

* The body font for Expedia's design is clearly geometric, but I couldn't find an exact match anywhere. So I opted for [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans), a low-contrast geometric sans serif that matched up pretty close.
* The color system was pretty simple. The neutral colors, or "grays," are all tinted blue (a 234 hue on the HSB/HSL scale), which pulls off a AAA rating against both the slick yellow (I _really_ like their yellow) and white. There are a few interface colors I didn't recreate here (mainly red and green).
* Taking cues from [Mike Ridd's method of creating form components](https://twitter.com/ridd_design/status/1430999115270279173?s=20), and then making those components interactive, I spun up a pretty simple prototype.
