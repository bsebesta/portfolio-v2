title: Overcoming Poor Posture
subtitle: A Systematic Approach to Refining Your Posture for Health and Performance
description: "Written by two physical therapists who have worked with thousands of people around the world, Overcoming Poor Posture is based on one simple idea: there is no such thing as perfect posture. No two bodies are alike, and we'll teach you how to find your own best alignment so you can live each day in health and comfort while performing your best in all the activities that matter to you. Instead of a painful issue to fix, you'll learn to think of your postural alignment as a dynamic component of how you sit, stand, and move in your body."
