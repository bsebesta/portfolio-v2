title: "Jacob: A Brief Theological Introduction"
description: "In one of the Book of Mormon's most magisterial passages, the lord of a vineyard looks over his beloved olive trees with great sorrow and strives to redeem them. This parable symbolizes Jesus Christ's labors to save not only individual souls, but an entire world. Perhaps more than any other Book of Mormon prophet, Jacob manifests the same divine anxiety, having been born in a 'wild wilderness' and inheriting the task of uniting a divided people."
