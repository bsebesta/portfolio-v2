# portfolio-v2
This is my WIP portfolio. It's a space for me to write; to plant my digital garden; to showcase my work; and to experiment with code.

## Current Stack
My current stack involves:
* Hugo
* Netlify
* Phosphorous Icons

## Digital Garden IA
Right now, I've borrowed liberally from [Maggie Appleton's digital garden IA](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) as a starting point, while I experiment and try to figure out what works for me.

* Each note

* My CSS styling conventions
* I have a general-purpose CSS class `.page-general`, applied to `<main>`. This does a few things:
    * The header is wider than the body.
* I have other page classes:
    * `.page-home`
