title: Emotional Intelligence
subtitle: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ
description: "Today everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our 'two minds'—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren’t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work."

Goleman, a pioneer in making emotion research more accessible he suggests that emotional intelligence—founded on a profound self- and social-awareness, as well as grasp of emotion's purpose and variation—is undervalued in our society. A keen grasp of ourselves as emotional beings is vital to our happiness and flourishing. Reading this during my first real period of unemployment was _especially_ revealing, because it revealed several anxieties and excitements, several fears and sadnesses. I'm learning to pay better attention to those emotional depths, and that itself is emotional intelligence in practice.

One thing I wish Goleman had given more attention to was the actual nuances of the emotional spectrum. He covers the core emotions, but doesn't really dive into the subtle variations of each emotion. Paul Ekman's [Atlas of Emotions](https://atlasofemotions.org/), done at the behest of the Dalai Lama, was a terrific supplement to Goleman's books in this regard, as was his model of trigger/experience/response. (Ekman was the main consultant for crafting Pixar's terrific movie _Inside Out_.)

All-in-all, though, a valuable read for me. One avenue for exploration that needs exploring still is—what is the relationship between my UX design work and emotions? How does emotional context and emotional sway factor into my process and final products? Aaron Walter's [Designing for Emotion](https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion) is probably my next go-to. In addition, Brené Brown's recent release [Atlas of the Heart](https://brenebrown.com/book/atlas-of-the-heart/) could be useful in gathering more information about the varieties of emotional experience.
