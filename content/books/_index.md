I love books. Below are a selection of the books I've read in the past decade that have informed my approach to design, research, strategy, technology, work, and life.

I love books. I read because
* To know I'm not alone
* To break the frozen ice within me
* To "take me lands away". At it's simplest, it's mere escape. At its best, it inculcates empathy.
* To relieve my "poverty of concepts"
