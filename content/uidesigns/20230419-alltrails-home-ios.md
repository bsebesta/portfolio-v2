I recreated [the homepage of the AllTrails app](https://mobbin.com/screens/f74fe207-ba66-4e8b-a25c-e533bb2a78bd) in Figma. Some things learned:

* I'm 99% sure AllTrails uses the [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) pack.
* The font is _close_ to San Francisco, but it's not _quite_ San Francisco. (For example, the descender in the Y is curved in San Francisco, but not in the actual text of the app.) Since I'm under a time constraint for this, I didn't try to figure out the difference; it was close enough.

Also, a new Figma plugin discovery: [TinyImage Compressor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789009980664807964/TinyImage-Compressor), which allowed me to export this into WebP.
