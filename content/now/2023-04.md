Well, I'm a little over a month into my self-declared "sabbatical" and it's been great. The main update: after years of _wanting_ to do it, my new website is launched! And it's not _just_ a portfolio of my design work. Since one of my strengths is [intellection](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252284/intellection-theme.aspx#:~:text=People%20exceptionally%20talented%20in%20the,Intellection%2C%20are%20strongest%20in%20them.)—I have over 1000 [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), many on design topics, stored in my personal [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault—I wanted this website to be a place to share my knowledge, make my knowledge visible, [think in public](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/), and grow a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/).

I'm still in the process of adding notes, as I'm taking this opportunity to revise my personal thinking for public. And I'm still working to make more robust components for [adding other media](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#5-intercropping--content-diversity) and [art direction](https://daverupert.com/2021/01/art-direction-for-static-sites/). But the MVP is _shipped_, as we say. Time to learn and iterate.

It was really fun to be writing code again, jumping between Figma, VS Code, and my browser in tight loops. It's also been to implement some terrific responsive design strategies like [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) and responsive type using [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/). Man alive, what we can do with layouts on the web now is _incredible_. (I remember having to fiddle with the `float` property to get a simple sidebar layout.)

I've also been playing with AI, mainly ChatGPT and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). CoPilot is both incredibly helpful and incredibly annoying—helpful in many of its suggestions, but when it tries to suggest something too early (like when I'm pausing) it really distracts me from what I'm trying to do.

Side project news: I'm **helping my friend** [Garth Braithwaite](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garthdb/)—Senior Engineer at Adobe and founding member of Adobe's [Spectrum Design System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/)—on a _really_ cool project. Can't say anything about it yet, but I'm stoked for when it launches.

And I will say, since declaring this time period a Sabbatical (see my March update), my mental health has really improved. I've spent more time with friends, with the guitar, and with reading good books. Some especially good reads lately include Abby Covert's [How to Make Sense of Any Mess](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/), Daniel Goleman's [Emotional Intelligence]({{< relref "Emotional Intelligence" >}}), and Emily Wilson's [The Odyssey](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-odyssey-francis-caulfeild/18217775?ean=9780393356250). Hoping to read more fiction going forward.
