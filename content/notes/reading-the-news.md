In today's world, information is more accessible than ever before. The news surrounds us, from social media to television broadcasts and newspapers. As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), engaging with the news is an essential part of being informed citizens and contributing to society. However, it's important to approach news consumption with faith, discernment, and a theology that aligns with our spiritual beliefs. This article will outline a possible Latter-Day Saint theology of reading the news and provide guidance on how to navigate the information landscape.[^1]

## Seek Truth and Knowledge
As Latter-Day Saints, we are encouraged to seek truth and knowledge in all aspects of life. In Doctrine and Covenants 88:118, we are instructed to "seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith." Reading the news is one way to pursue knowledge and become more informed about the world around us. However, it is essential to use discernment when evaluating the credibility of news sources and the accuracy of the information presented.

## Use the Holy Ghost as a Guide
In our pursuit of truth, we can rely on the guidance of the Holy Ghost. As we read the news, we should seek the Spirit's assistance in discerning truth from error and identifying information that is consistent with our beliefs and values. By inviting the Holy Ghost into our news consumption, we can be more confident in our understanding of the world and our ability to make informed decisions.

## Be Responsible Consumers
As Latter-Day Saints, we have a responsibility to be honest and fair in our interactions with others. This extends to our consumption of news, as we should strive to be responsible consumers by verifying the credibility of news sources, avoiding the spread of misinformation, and being cautious of our own biases. As we engage with the news, it is important to remain humble and open to new information, even if it challenges our preconceived notions.

## Promote Civil Discourse
The gospel teaches us to love and respect one another, despite our differences. As we read the news and discuss current events, we should strive to engage in respectful, civil discourse. This means avoiding contentious or divisive language, and seeking understanding through active listening and thoughtful communication. By promoting civil discourse, we can foster unity and understanding within our communities and exemplify the teachings of Christ.

## Seek Opportunities to Serve and Uplift Others
In our interactions with the news, we should be mindful of the opportunities to serve and uplift others. As we become more informed about the world, we can identify areas where we can make a difference and contribute to the betterment of society. Our faith in Jesus Christ should motivate us to act compassionately and selflessly, and our engagement with the news should inspire us to seek out ways to exemplify His teachings in our daily lives.

## Conclusion
A Latter-Day Saint theology of reading the news calls for a balanced and responsible approach to information consumption. By seeking truth and knowledge, using the Holy Ghost as a guide, being responsible consumers, promoting civil discourse, and looking for opportunities to serve others, we can navigate the modern information landscape with faith and discernment. As we engage with the news, let us remember our spiritual beliefs and strive to be examples of Christ in all aspects of our lives.
