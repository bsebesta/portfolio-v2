title: "Telling God's Story"
subtitle: "A Parents' Guide to Teaching the Bible"
description: "A new religion curriculum from the team that brought you The Story of the World. In this accessible and engaging book, Peter Enns (author of the controversial and best-selling Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament) provides parents and teachers with a straightforward and intelligent twelve-year plan for teaching the Bible. Written for lay readers but incorporating the best scholarly insights, Telling Godâ€™s Story avoids sectarian agendas. Instead, Enns suggests beginning with the parables of the Gospels for the youngest students; continuing on with the more complex stories of the Old and New Testaments for middle grade students; and guiding high school students into an understanding of the history and culture of biblical times."
