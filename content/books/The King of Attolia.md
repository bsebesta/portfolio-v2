title: The King of Attolia
description: "Eugenides, no stranger to desperate circumstances, has gotten himself into difficulties he canâ€™t get out of. Used to being treated with a certain measure of wariness, if not respect, he suffers the pranks, insults, and intrigue of the Attolian court with dwindling patience. As usual, nothing is as it appears when he rescues a hot-headed young soldier in the Palace Guard."
