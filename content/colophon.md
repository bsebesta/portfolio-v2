title: Colophon

The website was made principally by using Figma, VS Code, and a browser. It's statically generated via Hugo, and deployed through Netlify. The code is all hand-made, with a few minor suggestions provided by [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). You can see all code via [the public GitHub repository](https://github.com/bsebesta/portfolio-v2).

The font pairing is [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=Sorkin+Type) and [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans?query=noto+sans). The former font, Merriweather, was introduced to me by Ellen Luptonâ€”the family is used as the body type in her books on type.

Inspiration for this iteration of my website's design is drawn from a variety of people that I admire from afar: [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/), [Nate Balwdin](https://natebaldw.in/#/), [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/), [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/), [Bryant Hodson](https://bryanthodson.com/), [Melvin Dinata](https://www.melvindinata.com/), and [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/).
