title: Conversations with Things
subtitle: UX Design for Chat and Voice
description: "Welcome to the future, where you can talk with the digital things around you: voice assistants, chatbots, and more. But these interactions can be unhelpful and frustrating—sometimes even offensive or biased. Conversations with Things teaches you how to design conversations that are useful, ethical, and human–centered—because everyone deserves to be understood, especially you."

In the past, I've recommended Cathy Pearl's O'Reilly book, "Designing Voice User Interfaces," as the standard go-to for beginning conversational designers. But this book updates many ideas there and brings it into more current technology stacks and best practices, systematically breaking down the task of designing conversations "that are useful, ethical, and human–centered. The chapters on persona design and voice/tone selection was especially good. Recommended for anyone interested in conversational UI design.
