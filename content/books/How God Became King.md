title: How God Became King
subtitle: The Forgotten Story of the Gospels
description: "It has been slowly dawning on me over many years that there is a fundamental problem deep at the heart of Christian faith and practice as I have known it... we have all forgotten what the four gospels are about.' With this surprising and radical assertion, highly respected theologian and former Bishop of Durham Tom Wright launches a groundbreaking work sure to shake up and revolutionise much Christian thinking on the very heart and meaning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Tom Wright leads us, intelligently and graciously to seeing the new reality of the gospel story; one that is so explosive that the church in many generations has found it too much to take and so has watered it down rather than allowing its full impact to be felt."
