title: A Little History
---

Growing up in California, I got hooked on web design early. My parents got me Microsoft FrontPage one Christmas, and next thing I knew, I was running the largest LEGO Bionicle reference site on the web.

In High School, I became the captain of the Varsity Web Team (really), teaching web design to peers and junior classmenâ€”and becoming known by my teachers as the kid to ask about computer problems.

I moved to Utah to attend college. While there, I shuffled around as a history major, a marketing director, an instructional designer, and president of the BYU UX Club. After graduation, I did UX field research and interviews for the award-winning [Day One App](https://dayoneapp.com/). From there, I took a job with RAIN Agency in New York City, where I lived and worked for several years.

My life's been eclectic. I've been a marketing director; an adjunct at a university, teaching UX and conversational UI design; a sommelier and taste guide at an artisanal chocolate shop; an instructional designer for an IT company; the voice recorder of an audiobook; and a Sunday School teacher for teens. This breadth of experience has helped me become an [eclectic generalist]({{< relref "eclectic-generalists" >}}). I love learning and growing and trying new things.
