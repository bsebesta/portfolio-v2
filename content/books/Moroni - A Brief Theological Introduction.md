title: "Moroni: A Brief Theological Introduction"
description: "The call to pure love marks the culmination of Moroni's book--and thus of the Book of Mormon. In his concluding messages, Moroni draws from various sources—including his own father's prophetic witness—to teach that love must be the lens through which we come to understand out Savior. It is the essential quality in our quest to become like him."
