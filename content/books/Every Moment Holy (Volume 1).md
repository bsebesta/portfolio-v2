title: Every Moment Holy
description: "Every Moment Holy is a book of liturgies for the ordinary events of daily lifeâ€”liturgies such as 'A Liturgy for Feasting with Friends' or 'A Liturgy for Laundering' or 'A Liturgy for the First Hearthfire of the Season.' These are ways of reminding us that our lives are shot through with sacred purpose even when, especially when, we are too busy or too caught up in our busyness to notice."
